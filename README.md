# Python-AWS-APIs

Task for the Python+AWS job 

I have created two APIs 

	- Add a user , Stores the data in amazon s3 bucket, tested=OK
  
	- Fetches all the user profiles in json format, tested=OK

**Note :**

	Step1 - Before running the code please add your aws access key id and aws secret access key id in the code.
  
	Step2 - If you want to test the code , please create a bucket named 'talentboardusers' in AWS S3 storage.
  
	Step3 - once done, test using POSTMAN	, as I have not created any frontend.
  
	Step4 - to add a user type 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/add/<your user profile name>
  
	Step5 - Make sure to replace PORT Number if it's different.
